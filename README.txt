AHEM.

okay so how to use this junk is as follows:

SETTING THE MOUSE POS:
press the very well named "select pos" button then hover the mouse over the TOP SEARCH BAR WHERE THE URLs ARE then press q

SETTINGS:
first horizontal slider is for the amount of searches, do in patches of 10 and try only 1 first, second slider which is vertical is for time between each search, 1 to 10 seconds, best to keep at 3-6, increase if your internet is slow and it takes time to load

STARTING THE MACRO:
press the very well named "start macro" button then watch and enjoy

STOPPING THE MACRO:
if for some reason you need to stop the macro mid way through, PRESS AND HOLD Q till it stops

i have seen other people try to make something similar but most of them were over engineering the program and doing way too much, this in my opinion should be the easiest solution

note: btw the mouse pos is set as a to the start of the URL bar, which means on a 1920x1080 display it SHOULD work without the first step, but again, just try it with ONE search only at first THEN do multiple, also don't set time to 1 even if your internet is fast, because edge will recognize that you are searching too quickly and just stop adding points <3
