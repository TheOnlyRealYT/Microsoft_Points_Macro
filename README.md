# Microsoft_Points_Macro
A very simple macro I made to grind Microsoft points for me.

hello!!!!!

okay so how to use this is as follows:

# SETTING THE MOUSE POS:
press the very well named "select pos" button then hover the mouse over the TOP SEARCH BAR WHERE THE URLs ARE then press q

# SETTINGS:
first horizontal slider is for the amount of searches, do in patches of 10 and try only 1 first, second slider which is vertical is for time between each search, 1 to 10 seconds, best to keep at 3-6, increase if your internet is slow and it takes time to load

# STARTING THE MACRO:
press the very well named "start macro" button then watch and enjoy

# STOPPING THE MACRO:
if for some reason you need to stop the macro mid way through, PRESS AND HOLD Q till it stops

# THINGS TO COME:
there is a success.mp3 in the files, for now its not implemented to play when the macro finishes, I will probably fix it soon
and I will separete the thread for checking for Q input and the thread which runs the main macro so that you don't have to hold Q anymore

i have seen other people try to make something similar but most of them were over engineering the program and doing way too much, this in my opinion should be the easiest solution (and other solutions that included using the browser ui got patched)

note: btw the mouse pos is set as a to the start of the URL bar, which means on a 1920x1080 display it SHOULD work without the first step, but again, just try it with ONE search only at first THEN do multiple, also don't set time to 1 even if your internet is fast, because edge will recognize that you are searching too quickly and just stop adding points <3
